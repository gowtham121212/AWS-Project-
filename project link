Over 30% of websites on the internet trust WordPress as their Content Management System (CMS). It's not just for blogs; it powers e-commerce sites, forums, and more.
Dived deep into the technical intricacies of setting up a scalable infrastructure on the cloud. From provisioning EC2 instances to configuring web server Apache, fine-tuning database system MySQL, 
and seamlessly integrating WordPress, as we navigate through EC2 instance creation, security group configurations, server-side optimizations, and database management. 
With hands-on experience in setting up LAMP or LEMP stacks, 
and harnessing the power of Elastic IP addresses for seamless domain mapping, this project empowers you to architect robust, high-performance websites on AWS.
Here are the benefits of using AWS to deploy WordPress:
• Scalability: AWS can easily scale your WordPress website as your traffic grows.
• Security: AWS provides a secure environment for your WordPress website.
